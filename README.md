# oral_properties
This folder contains the measured and predicted thermo-physical data of different oral sites of normal patient, patient with oral squamous cell carcinoma and oral submucosa fibrosis.

Note: To maintain anonymity, the sheet number corresponds to each patient that is represented by unique patient Id.
